## Description

This project  will enable us to explore ray-casting. Our goal will be to make a dynamic view inside a maze, in which we will have to find our way. 

## Overview

We must create a “realistic” 3D graphical representation of the inside of a maze from a first-person perspective. We have to create this representation using the Ray-Casting principles.

## Testing

This project has been tested with valgrind and contains no leaks.  
All tests return : `All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible`.
